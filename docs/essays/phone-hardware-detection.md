# Phone Hardware Detection

There are numerous hardware components in mobile phones. How can we determine the condition of these hardware components? This article provides a solution for detecting the hardware of mobile phones. The detection methods can be broadly categorized into:
Â©
  - Technical solution, implemented through code
  - Engineering solution, implemented through business methods which will be enclosed in brackets in Implementation section
  - Hybrid solution, combining technical and engineering solution
  
## Implementation

| Hardware Component | Weight | Android                           | IOS                                | Web                              |

## Scoring

Different weights are assigned to various hardware components based on their priority. Then, the scores are calculated by combining the weights of all detected items, resulting in a total score out of 100.

```
totalWeight = sum(weight)
totalScore = (sum of weights of detection passed items) / totalWeight * 100
```

## Caveat

This solution assumes that the mobile phone is able to boot and run apps or open a browser, so components like the `CPU` and `RAM` are assumed to be functioning properly and do not need to be tested.
